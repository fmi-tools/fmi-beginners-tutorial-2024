1.	Bio
* Cláudio Ângelo Gonçalves Gomes: I'm an assistant professor at Aarhus University focusing on co-simulation and its combination with numerical
analysis, formal methods, and applied mathematics. I got my PhD from the University of Antwerp on the foundations for co-simulation. 
* Christian Bertsch: I studied Mathematics and Physics at Heidelberg University before joining Robert Bosch GmbH in 2021 as a simulation engineer. Today I am a project manager at Bosch Research, and since 2022 project leader of the FMI project within the Modelica Association.
* Maurizio Palmieri: 
3.	Title: FMI Beginner's tutorial
4.	Abstract
* Goal: In this tutorial, organized by the FMI project, the basic concepts of the FMI standard are introduced and demonstrated.
* Audience: We target industrial practicioners and young researchers who have limited programming knowledge.
* Structure: The first part consists of a presentation of the motivation, history, the FMI project, the basic technical idea, the different FMI versions, limitations and the current state of tool support. In the second part, hands-on exercises are given to gain first experience with creating, checking, coupling and simulating FMUs in different open source and commercial tools this second part can also viewed as a demonstration where the exercises are done by the presenters, if the software tools are not available. At the end an outlook is given on further material: other resources such as tutorial modules for mote advanced usage of FMI.
5.	Learning objectives: After the tutorial, the attendees will be able to:
* Understand the motivation and history of the FMI project.
* Know how to export, import, and interact with, an FMU (a simulation model packaged according to the FMI standard), and will have a basic understanding of how a co-simulation is run.
* Have a basic grasp of the main pitfalls when interacting with FMUs.
* Have a collection of reference materials and tools that are useful when developing
6.	Prerequisite knowledge of participants: while not mandatory, the following skills may make the experience better:
* Knowledge of command line software
* Limited experience with the python programming language
* Limited knowledge of jupyter notebooks
* Limited knowledge of how a drivetrain works
