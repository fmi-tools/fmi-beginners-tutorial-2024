### A brief bio of each of you.

* Christian Bertsch studied Mathematics and Physics at Heidelberg University before joining Robert Bosch GmbH in 2021 as a simulation engineer. Today he is a project manager at Bosch Research, and since 2022 project leader of the FMI project within the Modelica Association.
* Cláudio Ângelo Gonçalves Gomes …
* Maurizio Palmieri ….

### The title of the tutorial: 

* Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) – Beginner’s Tutorial with Hands-On Exercice

### An abstract: 
The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a free standard that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic simulation models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code, distributed as a ZIP file. With support by 190+ tools it is the de-facto industry standard for tool-independent model exchange. 
The first part of this tutorial consists of a presentation of the motivation, history, the FMI project, the basic technical idea, the different FMI versions, limitations and the current state of tool support.  In the second part, hands-on exercises are given to gain first experience with creating, checking, coupling and simulating FMUs in different open source and commercial tools. This second part can also viewed as a demonstration where the exercises are done by the presenters, if the software tools are not available. At the end an outlook is given on further material: other resources such as tutorial modules for more advanced usage of FMI.

### Aims and learning objectives: 
* General introduction to the Functional-Mock-Up Interface
* First experience with using FMI 

### Prerequisite knowledge of participants
* Basic knowledge of modelling and simulation
* Bringing a laptop and pre-install some tools before the tutorial
